This is a simple python script that can be utliized to change the case of strings. For now, it's only a Python script that converts strings to **Kebab Case**. Plans are to implement this script in a pip package, and add functions to converts strings to other cases as well.

## Example, with default options

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Input: `Kebab case folder name`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output: `kebab-case-folder-name`

## To DO

- [ ] Modify the script to take in command line arguments as inputs.
- [ ] Read lines in a text file and convert each to Kebab Case.
