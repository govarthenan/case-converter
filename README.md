This is a simple python script that can be utliized to change the case of strings. For now, it's only a Python script that converts strings to **Kebab Case**. Plans are to implement this script in a pip package, and add functions to converts strings to other cases as well.

Example, with default options:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Input: `Kebab case folder name`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output: `kebab-case-folder-name`
